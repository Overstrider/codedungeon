# codedungeon-dev-cycle

Use for complex features, multi-repo changes, or work that needs the full phase lifecycle.

Steps:
- Ensure a codedungeon run exists with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon phase init` when needed.
- Execute phases in order: `0`, `1`, `2'`, `3.5`, `4`, `5`, `5.5`, `5.6`, `6`, `7`.
- For each phase, inspect state with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon phase info <phase>`.
- Use `./.codex/bin/codedungeon spawn-prompt <phase>` to compose phase context.
- When spawning a Codex subagent, pass the `agent_type`, `model`, and `reasoning_effort` emitted by `spawn-prompt <phase>`.
- Use Codex subagents from `.codex/agents` only when delegation is explicitly useful; do not rely on agent TOML files to choose model or effort.
- Close each phase with `./.codex/bin/codedungeon phase done`.

Do not treat `.codex/commands` as an executable command system. Those files are reference playbooks.
